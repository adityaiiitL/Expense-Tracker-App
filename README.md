# Getting Started with Expense Tracker App

This project has been deployed over this URL: (https://my-expense-tracker-speechly.netlify.app/)

## About this

Expense Tracker Application is an application that helps to keep an accurate record of your money inflow and outflow. Many people in India live on a fixed income, and they find that towards the end of the month they don't have sufficient money to meet their needs.

Expense Tracker Application stores your income and expense data very efficiently in a form of a Dynamic Chart that allows you to compare or find out what all income or expenses are the most at present. According to your need, you can select or deselect which transactions you have to show over or not.

### What All it Involves?

The Application is built upon various Javascript and React js concepts such as:

- State Management using React Context APIs.
- Saving Data into Local Storage.
- Creatung a User Internface using Material UI.
- Scalable React folder structure.
- Adding voice capability using Speechly API.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
